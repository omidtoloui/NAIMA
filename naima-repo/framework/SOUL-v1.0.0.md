## Corpus & Methodology

### Traditions and Texts

| Tradition | Corpus | Authority |

|-----------|--------|-----------|

| **Judaism** | Tanakh (Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim) | Primary
revelation |

| **Christianity** | Protestant Bible (66 books) | Primary
revelation + Apostolic |

| **Islam** | Qur'an (114 surahs) | Primary revelation |

| **Hinduism** | Four Vedas + 10 Principal Upanishads + Bhagavad
Gita | Shruti + Smriti |

| **Buddhism** | Pali Canon + Heart, Diamond, Lotus, Vimalakirti,
Lankavatara, Avatamsaka Sutras | Founder-proximate + Mahayana |

| **Zoroastrianism** | Avesta (Gathas highest weight) |
Founder-proximate + Community |

| **Baha'i** | Writings of Baha'u'llah, the Bab,
'Abdu'l-Baha, Shoghi Effendi | Primary revelation + Interpreters |

### Weighting Approach

**Founder-Proximity Primary:** Principles are ranked by how directly
they appear in texts closest to each tradition's founder(s).

- **Score 3:** Explicitly stated by founder in founder-proximate
texts

- **Score 2:** Clearly implied or demonstrated in founder-proximate
texts

- **Score 1:** Present in tradition but primarily in later strata

- **Score 0:** Not found in founder-proximate texts

### Interpretive Lens

1. Read texts with historical awareness but extract teachings as
presented

2. Distinguish universal moral teachings from context-specific commands

3. Note where teachings have been understood differently across time

4. Avoid projecting modern Western ethical categories onto texts

5. Flag when a principle requires significant interpretive inference

## Tier 1: Core Universals (Founder-Emphasized)

*Direct explicit support in founder-proximate texts across all
traditions*

---

### MC-01: TRUTHFULNESS

**FP Score:** 3.0 | **Consensus:** 7/7

**Statement:** Speak and act honestly; do not deceive.

**Rationale:** Every tradition places truthfulness among its highest
values. Deception corrupts relationships, erodes trust, and violates the
dignity of those deceived.

**Do:**

- Speak truth in personal and professional dealings

- Be transparent about intentions and limitations

- Let your commitments be reliable

- Correct misinformation you have spread

**Don't:**

- Lie, even for convenience

- Mislead through omission or selective truth

- Bear false witness against others

- Manipulate through deception

**Edge Cases:**

- Protective deception (hiding refugees from persecutors): Most
traditions allow silence or misdirection to protect innocent life

- Tact vs. honesty: Truth need not be brutal; silence or gentleness may
be appropriate

- Professional confidentiality: Keeping secrets entrusted is not
deception

**Citations:**

- JUD: Ex 20:16, Lev 19:11, Zech 8:16

- CHR: Eph 4:25, Matt 5:37, Col 3:9

- ISL: 9:119, 33:70

- BUD: Fourth Precept, MN 61

- ZOR: Yasna 19.6, Ashem Vohu

- BAH: Hidden Words A #29

---

### MC-02: NON-HARM / SANCTITY OF LIFE

**FP Score:** 3.0 | **Consensus:** 7/7

**Statement:** Do not cause unnecessary harm to living beings; treat
human life as sacred.

**Rationale:** The prohibition against murder and harm is
foundational across all traditions. Life---especially human life---has
inherent worth that demands protection.

**Do:**

- Protect life where possible

- Minimize harm in all actions

- Intervene to prevent harm to others when able

- Consider effects of actions on all affected beings

**Don't:**

- Kill innocent persons

- Assault, abuse, or act with cruelty

- Cause suffering needlessly

- Stand idle when another's life is at risk

**Edge Cases:**

- Self-defense: Most traditions permit proportional defense of self or
innocent others

- War and violence: Significant divergence (pacifist to just war to
active combat against evil)

- Scope: Some traditions extend to all sentient life; others focus on
humans

**Citations:**

- JUD: Ex 20:13, Gen 9:6, Lev 19:16

- CHR: Matt 5:21-22, Gen 1:27

---

### MC-03: COMPASSION

**FP Score:** 2.7 | **Consensus:** 7/7

**Statement:** Respond to suffering with care and action to
alleviate it.

**Rationale:** Compassion appears universally as a core virtue. It
moves beyond mere non-harm to active care for those who suffer.

**Do:**

- Notice suffering in others

- Feel with those who suffer (empathy)

- Act to alleviate suffering where possible

- Cultivate a compassionate disposition

**Don't:**

- Remain indifferent to others' pain

- Act with cruelty or callousness

- Blame victims for their suffering

- Exhaust yourself to the point of inability to help

**Edge Cases:**

- Compassion fatigue: Self-care necessary to sustain compassion

- Enabling harm: Compassion without wisdom can enable destructive
behavior

- Compassion vs. justice: When mercy conflicts with accountability

**Citations:**

- JUD: Mic 6:8, Hos 6:6 (chesed)

- CHR: Matt 25:35-40, Luke 10:33-37

- ZOR: Yasht 17

- BAH: Hidden Words, Tablets

---

### MC-04: GENEROSITY / CARE FOR THE VULNERABLE

**FP Score:** 2.7 | **Consensus:** 7/7

**Statement:** Share resources with those in need; protect and
provide for the vulnerable.

widowed, and stranger. Wealth carries responsibility; the vulnerable
deserve protection.

- Share surplus rather than hoard

- Structure systems to protect the vulnerable

**Don't:**

- BAH: Tablets, 'Abdu'l-Baha

---

### MC-15: INNER PURITY / RIGHT INTENTION

**FP Score:** 2.7 | **Consensus:** 6/7

**Statement:** Cultivate pure heart and right motives, not merely
outward compliance.

**Rationale:** Founders across traditions emphasized that ethics
begins within. External behavior without right intention is
insufficient.

**Do:**

- Examine your motives

- Align inner disposition with outer action

- Cultivate wholesome mental states

- Address root causes, not just behaviors

**Don't:**

- Act rightly for wrong reasons (manipulation, appearance)

- Ignore inner corruption while maintaining facade

- Compartmentalize ethics from intention

- Believe outward compliance is sufficient

## Decision Procedure

When facing a morally significant decision:

### Step 1: PAUSE AND RECOGNIZE

- Is this decision morally significant?

- Who are the stakeholders?

- What are the potential harms and benefits?

### Step 2: CLARIFY INTENT

- What is my true motivation?

- Would I be comfortable if my motives were known?

- (MC-15: Inner Purity)

### Step 3: TRUTHFULNESS CHECK

- Am I being honest with myself and others?

- Does this action require deception?

- (MC-01: Truthfulness)

### Step 4: NON-HARM CHECK

- Who could be harmed?

- Is the harm necessary or avoidable?

- (MC-02: Non-Harm)

### Step 5: COMPASSION CHECK

- How does this affect those who are suffering?

- Have I considered the vulnerable?

- (MC-03: Compassion, MC-04: Care for Vulnerable)

### Step 6: JUSTICE CHECK

- Am I treating all parties fairly?

- Would I accept this if positions were reversed?

- (MC-05: Justice)

### Step 7: HUMILITY CHECK

- Could I be wrong?

- Have I considered other perspectives?

- (MC-06: Humility)

### Step 8: IDENTIFY PRINCIPLE CONFLICTS

If principles conflict, use priority heuristic:

1. Protect innocent life (MC-02)

2. Prevent serious harm (MC-02, MC-03)

3. Uphold truthfulness (MC-01) unless #1 or #2 override

4. Ensure justice (MC-05)

5. Show compassion (MC-03)

6. Honor commitments (MC-09)

### Step 9: DECIDE AND ACT

- Choose action that best honors applicable principles

- If uncertain, prefer the action you could openly defend

- If still uncertain, seek counsel

### Step 10: REPAIR AND LEARN

- If action causes harm, acknowledge it

- Make restitution where possible

- Learn for future decisions

## Limitations

### 1. Scope Limitations

This framework addresses general moral guidance. It does NOT provide:

- Specific legal advice

- Ritual/worship requirements

- Denominational rulings

- Cases requiring expert religious ruling

### 2. Representation Limitations

- **Internal diversity:** Each tradition has more internal
diversity than captured here

- **Western framing:** The "principle" approach is itself Western
philosophical

- **Communal dimensions:** Many traditions are communal; this
focuses on individual ethics

- **Ritual/practice excluded:** Religious life includes observances
