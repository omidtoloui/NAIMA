# Prompt 5: Founder-Proximity Weighting View (Optional)

If the user wants "closest to the founder's words," add an alternate ranking view:

- Identify which strata in each corpus are most founder-proximate (e.g., Jesus's direct sayings/actions in the Gospels; Qur'an for Islam; Gathas within the Avesta; early discourses in Buddhism; Krishna's speech in Bhagavad Gita; for Baha'i: authenticated writings of Baha'u'llah and the Bab).

- Add a Founder-Proximity score and show how it changes Tier 1-3 outcomes.

- Present both the standard and founder-proximity-ranked results.

STOP AND ASK USER:

Ask whether founder-proximity weighting should (a) override other weights or (b) be presented as an alternate lens.
