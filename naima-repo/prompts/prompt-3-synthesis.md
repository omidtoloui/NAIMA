# Prompt 3: Cross-Tradition Synthesis — Ontology + Mapping + Scoring

You have Principle Sets for each tradition.

Goal:

Identify common moral and spiritual truths across ALL 7 traditions, without flattening real differences.

## Step 1: Build a neutral "principle ontology"

- List candidate shared principles (truthfulness, compassion, justice, humility, restraint, care for vulnerable, integrity, self-control, etc.).
- Define each in neutral language that does not assume a specific theology.

## Step 2: Map each tradition's principles to the ontology

- Create a mapping matrix: Ontology Principle -> linked tradition principles (with citations).
- Mark match strength: Direct/Explicit, Strong/Implicit, Weak/Tenuous.

## Step 3: Scoring model

Provide:

- Universality score (coverage across traditions)
- Centrality score (how core it is within each tradition)
- Explicitness score (direct teaching vs inference)
- Actionability score (decision-guiding clarity)
- Optional: Non-controversy score (least dependent on disputed interpretive edges)

Provide two weighting presets:

Preset A: Strict consensus (explicit + central everywhere)

Preset B: Broad convergence (allows strong implicit support but flags it)

## Step 4: Common Moral Compass in three tiers

Tier 1: True universals (strong support in every tradition)

Tier 2: Near-universals (strong support in most, compatible with the rest)

Tier 3: Family resemblances (shared themes with meaningful divergence)

For each tier item include:

- Plain statement
- Operational guidance
- Boundaries/failure modes
- Evidence grid: each tradition gets 2-5 references and which of its principles support the item

## Step 5: Divergence map

List major divergence zones that affect real decisions (violence/self-defense, truth-telling edge cases, sexuality/family law, ritual vs ethics, salvation/liberation mechanics, etc.). Be descriptive, not polemical.

STOP AND ASK USER:

Ask the user to choose Preset A or B (or custom weights) before generating the system-ready artifact.
