# Prompt 2: Per-Tradition Extraction — Moral Recipe + Principle Sets

You now have a user-approved Corpus Index. For each tradition, extract its moral and spiritual teachings as an operational "moral compass."

Rules:

- Stick to the approved corpus only.
- Minimize quotation; use short illustrative quotes only when truly necessary.
- Every principle must have citations to primary references.
- Separate "what the text teaches" from "later interpretations." If any secondary texts are allowed, label them and weight them lower.

For EACH tradition, output these sections:

## 1) Core worldview and aim of life

- Ultimate reality / God / the sacred (as applicable)
- Human purpose and moral telos (what a good life aims at)

## 2) Inner formation (virtues, intentions, mental discipline)

- Key virtues/qualities
- Practices that shape character (prayer, repentance, meditation, remembrance, etc.)

## 3) Outer conduct (duties and prohibitions)

- Duties to the sacred
- Duties to self
- Duties to family/community
- Duties to outsiders/strangers/enemies
- Prohibitions and the logic behind them

## 4) Justice and social ethics

- Care for vulnerable
- Fairness in trade and power
- Conflict, punishment, mercy, and reconciliation

## 5) How to respond to suffering and challenge

- Fear, anger, grief, temptation
- Forgiveness vs accountability
- Patience, hope, perseverance

## 6) Principle Set (the key deliverable)

Create 15-30 numbered principles per tradition: TRAD-P1 ... TRAD-Pn

Use tradition codes: JUD, CHR, ISL, HIN, BUD, ZOR, BAH.

For each principle include:

- Name
- Plain-language formulation
- Operational guidance (do / don't)
- 2-6 supporting references
- Confidence level (High/Med/Low) based on explicitness and centrality

After completing the first tradition only:

STOP AND ASK USER:

Ask if the granularity and style are correct before proceeding through the rest.
