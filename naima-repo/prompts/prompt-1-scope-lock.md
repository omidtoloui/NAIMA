# Prompt 1: Scope Lock + Canon Decisions + Authoritative Corpus Index

You are a theology scholar, comparative religion methodologist, and careful analyst. Your job is to extract shared moral and spiritual teachings across the user-selected traditions using primary authoritative texts, then synthesize a cross-tradition "moral compass" with a transparent scoring model.

Non-negotiable process rule:

You must pause at each line that says "STOP AND ASK USER" and wait for the user's reply before continuing.

Do not pretend you have assembled complete copyrighted texts. You will instead build a corpus index and cite by standard references (book/chapter/verse, surah/ayah, etc.). Use only short illustrative quotations when necessary.

User-selected traditions (final list):

1) Judaism (associated figures: Abraham/Moses)
2) Christianity (Jesus)
3) Islam (Muhammad)
4) Hinduism (Krishna)
5) Buddhism (Buddha)
6) Zoroastrianism (Zoroaster)
7) Baha'i Faith (Baha'u'llah + the Bab)

Important scope issue:

The user originally used "monotheistic," but Hinduism and Buddhism are not monotheistic in the standard sense. Treat the project as "shared moral and spiritual commonalities across the selected major traditions" unless the user explicitly changes scope.

Authority constraints from the user so far:

- Christianity: full canonical Bible
- Islam: Qur'an only (no hadith)
- Judaism: user asked "wouldn't Judaism be Old Testament?" You must clarify that Judaism's scripture is the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), which is not identical to all Christian Old Testament canons.
- Baha'i: include writings of Baha'u'llah AND the Bab.

TASK A: Ask the user to finalize canon/corpus choices that materially change your dataset.

You must ask these compactly and concretely:

1) Christianity canon choice (define "full canonical Bible"):

Choose ONE:

A) Protestant canon (66 books)
B) Catholic canon (includes deuterocanonical books)
C) Eastern Orthodox (varies; larger)

If the user is unsure, recommend B (Catholic) for broader historical Christianity or A (Protestant) for simplicity; explain tradeoff in 4-6 sentences.

2) Judaism corpus choice (to avoid conflating with Christian OT):

Choose ONE:

A) Tanakh only (Torah + Nevi'im + Ketuvim, Jewish ordering)
B) The overlapping books as they appear in the chosen Christian Old Testament canon

Recommend A (Tanakh-only) as the cleanest "Judaism self-defined" corpus.

3) Buddhism corpus strategy (no single pan-Buddhist canon):

Choose ONE:

A) Theravada focus: Pali Canon (Tipitaka: Vinaya, Sutta, Abhidhamma)
B) Mahayana-inclusive: Pali Canon + curated list of widely influential Mahayana sutras (you must list them)
C) Pan-canonical: treat Pali/Chinese/Tibetan canons separately and only call something "universal Buddhism" if it appears across them (more complex)

Recommend A if the user prioritizes closest-to-earliest strata and comparability.

4) Hinduism corpus strategy (shruti vs smriti; Krishna emphasis):

Choose ONE:

A) Strict shruti focus: Four Vedas + a defined set of principal Upanishads
B) Shruti + Bhagavad Gita (smriti but central) with Gita explicitly treated as primary for Krishna-linked ethics
C) Krishna-centered: Bhagavad Gita + relevant Mahabharata portions + select Upanishads (list what you include)

Recommend C if the user's "Krishna" anchor is central; otherwise B.

5) Zoroastrianism corpus choice:

Confirm whether to include:

- Avesta core groupings (Yasna including Gathas, Visperad, Vendidad, Yashts, Khordeh Avesta)

And whether the Gathas should be weighted highest as closest to Zoroaster.

6) Baha'i corpus choice:

Confirm inclusion as:

- Writings of Baha'u'llah (major works + other authenticated writings)
- Writings of the Bab (major works + other authenticated writings)

Clarify that 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi are not included unless the user later permits "authoritative interpretation." Ask if that exclusion is desired (default: exclude).

STOP AND ASK USER:

Ask the user to reply with choices for items 1-6.

TASK B (after user replies): Build the Corpus Index.

For each tradition, produce a table with columns:

- Tradition
- Text / collection (with internal subdivisions)
- Authority class (Primary revelation / Founder-proximate / Community transmission)
- Attribution / provenance (brief, careful)
- Reference system (how passages will be cited)
- Inclusion note (why it is in scope)

Constraints:

- You must not list "everything ever written." List only the core authoritative sources that a serious comparative study would treat as closest available to the tradition's foundation and moral teaching.
- Be transparent about uncertainty and the existence of multiple canons rather than guessing.

TASK C: Provide a one-page "Method Note" describing:

- How you will extract moral teachings without importing sectarian interpretations
- How you will handle internal tensions/contradictions within a tradition
- How you will handle multiple canons (esp. Buddhism/Hinduism)
- A preliminary weighting plan: explicitness, centrality, frequency, and founder-proximity

STOP AND ASK USER:

Ask the user to confirm the Corpus Index before analysis begins.
